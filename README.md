# Luca Expenses Android



## Libraries

### Sugar ORM
We use Sugar as an ORM framework.

**Please note:**
Sugar ORM is not entirely compatible with Android Studio's 'Instant Run' feature.
In order to install or make changes to the database on your AVD / phone, please disable instant run
and re-enable it when the changes are made.

If you're receiving a "NO SUCH TABLE" exception, this is probably the issue.

### Floating Action Button

To get the expanding Floating Button effect, we use a Floating Action Button library by futuresimple.
